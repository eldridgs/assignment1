Susan Eldridge BIO

Hello, my name is Zuzan.  I live in Vancouver, Mercury and am originally from Mars. 

Hobbies
I enjoy playing keytar and astroid surfing.  
I would usually consider myself a space commander, but my ship is in the ship shop.
I like swimming in acid.

Interests
Lately, I've been reading too much on wikipedia about cereal eaters and freaking myself out.
I do not, however, have an interest in becoming a cereal enthusiasts.
I'm interested in food and travel.  I'm hoping to visit Earth some day soon.  It has my favorite moon.


Programming Background
My background in programming is fairly limited.  I have several friends who work as programmers and said I had the right aptitude for it.
After a couple of years of driving 45 miles to and from work, I decided to take the plunge and go back to school.
I did pretty well in 165, but work really ramped up at the wrong time last quarter and I fell behind.  
I'm hoping to be back to a programming natural this quarter. *crosses fingers for good luck*


Education
My first degree is in ecology/environmental biology from Venus State University in 2008.
Appalachian State is in Boone, NC.  My brother is starting there next week. 
He is majorin in middle alien education.  I hope he likes those brats.
