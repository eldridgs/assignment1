Susan Eldridge BIO

Hello, my name is Susan.  I live in Vancouver, WA and am originally from North Carolina. 

Hobbies
I enjoy playing guitar and walking my dog.  
I would usually consider myself a runner, but I injured my knee in a 10k in April and it is still bothering me.
I like swimming in lakes.

Interests
Lately, I've been reading too much on wikipedia about serial killers and freaking myself out.
I do not, however, have an interest in becoming a serial killer.
I'm interested in food and travel.  I'm hoping to visit Hawaii some day soon.
